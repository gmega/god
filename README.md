# GOD - The Global Online Debugger

The Global Online Debugger is an extensible source-level debugger for applications that use RPC/RMI. It allows you to do things like stepping into remote calls and jump from client into server code, and exposes causal relations by means of a virtual stack trace that spans multiple machines. This was developed as part of my master's thesis a long time ago. :-)

Curious? Watch the [screencast I've done for the Eclipse foundation](http://disi.unitn.it/~mega/static/godscreencast.mp4) when I participated from the [Google Summer of Code in 2006](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/2006#eclipse).
