Configuration Module:

- OK. Test multiple optional children of different types for same brach key precondition.
- OK. Test cardinality constraint checking.
- Add a binary 'incarnable' attribute to the specs. Validate incarnable attribute against type attribute in the configuration file.
- Add metadata attributes that don't go to the actual incarnation. 
- Let metadata attributes be specified both in the configuration file and the deployment descriptor.
- Semi-OK. Add default values. 
- OK. Add context.

Debugger:

- The event processing chains need some serious attention. The current design is crying for a refactoring
  in the sense of making the processing chains assembly explicit. 

- When a machine dies or gets reinserted, we must clean system-wide information about its threads. This includes
  the thread UUID registry and god knows what else.
  
- OK. Make step overs work. 
- OK. Test the full <CORBA Client>-<Reuters Server>-<JacORB NS> cycle. 

- The thread state relies heavily in pending step requests. However, the resume/suspend
  methods clear the step requests. Investigate how that affects the illusions, especially
  from the user point of view.

- Requests must be reworked. They currently advertise preconditions that never get satisfied and thus stay
  forever into the deferrable request queue. Internally they work because they acquire loaded classes. I think
  the ideal solution would be to eliminate the return null/non-null protocol and add a callback so that the request
  can adjust their advertised preconditions. 
  
Critical:

- I hadn't taken classloader into consideration when I first built the deferrable request subsystem.
  It'll need some serious reworking to work properly when we have the same class being loaded by more
  than one classloader.
