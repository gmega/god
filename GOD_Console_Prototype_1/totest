Configuration Module:

- OK. Test multiple optional children of different types for same brach key precondition.
- OK. Test cardinality constraint checking.
- Add a binary 'incarnable' attribute to the specs. Validate incarnable attribute against type attribute in the configuration file.
- Add metadata attributes that don't go to the actual incarnation. 
- Let metadata attributes be specified both in the configuration file and the deployment descriptor.
- Semi-OK. Add default values. 
- OK. Add context.

Debugger:

- The event processing chains need some serious attention. The current design is crying for a refactoring
  in the sense of making the processing chains assembly explicit. 

- When a machine dies or gets reinserted, we must clean system-wide information about its threads. This includes
  the thread UUID registry and god knows what else.
  
- Make step overs work. 
- Test the full <CORBA Client>-<Reuters Server>-<JacORB NS> cycle.
