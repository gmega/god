/**
 * This class matches resolution contexts into preconditions. When a deferrable request is inserted
 * onto this "queue", the queue tries to resolve it by checking whether its preconditions have or have 
 * not been met. If it can't solve the request (because it's preconditions haven't been met), the request
 * is stashed until all of it's unresolved preconditions are met. The "environment" is responsible for 
 * notifying the queue of resolved preconditions. The queue will, in turn, pump the resolution to all
 * interested requests.
 * 
 * There are a few things to remember when designing deferrable requests that will be inserted here:
 * 
 * 1 - The precondition list is fixed. Once you've inserted a deferrable request into the queue, you should 
 *     NOT change its advertised preconditions (or queue assumptions will go all wrong).
 * 
 * 2 - You must obey the resolution protocol for resolveNow (@see ddproto1.debugger.request.IDeferrableRequest)
 * 
 * 
 * Side note: As a result of two years of poking and very little time for refactoring, there are some
 * weird and some broken things here. This class - or even better, the whole "precondition-request"
 * matching scheme - should go through some refactoring or even redesigning in the near future. 
 * 
 * Issues:
 *  
 * (1)Initially this class only took care of breakpoint requests. My "addEagerlyResolve" method returns something
 *    that used to be an EventRequest, or null if the request had to be deferred.  Afterwards, I realised that 
 *    deferring requests is commonplace in asynchronous computations, because not everything that is required 
 *    by your request might be ready when you want to place that request. I then generalized this mechanism to 
 *    other types of requests, some of which don't have to return anything - they just have to notify the 
 *    original request placers. The worst blow, however, came with the fact that to each advertised precondition
 *    corresponds a different return value from IDeferrableRequest.resolveNow. This means I can't even decide 
 *    which value to return anymore. 
 *    
 *    Therefore, the return value of addEagerlyResolve became somewhat twisted and no-one uses it anymore, except 
 *    for this class. 
 *     
 * (2)The algorithm looks for solved preconditions and hands over a resolution context to the deferrable
 *    request. Since a deferrable request might place aditional requests as a side-effect, this raises a 
 *    concurrency concern: 
 *    
 *    If a precondition is met after the precondition cache is checked but before the deferrable request
 *    places its own requests, we might miss the precondition alltogether. While this might be fine in some
 *    cases, it might lead to malfunctioning of breakpoints, for instance. 
 *       
 * (3)Storage issues: all preconditions and resolution contexts are stored. This is a memory leak
 *    waiting to be noticed. While I could substitute caching of resolution contexts by dynamic 
 *    checking strategies, this wouldn't solve issue (2), so I don't know if it's worth the effort.
 *    
 * 
 *  There are many other design and implementation issues which I won't even bother to comment now, some
 *  of which preclude the breakpointing mechanism from working correctly in the presence of multiple 
 *  classloaders.
