 * This interface represents an attempt to decouple the stamp recovery
 * strategy (which is related to how the ORB implements its PICurrents)
 * and the rest of the program. 
 * 
 * The implementor may assume that all relevant CurrentSpecs will be passed
 * as parameters through the Iterator and that the "correct" PICurrent 
 * contains the desired thread id. 
 * 
 * Note: This operation might not be performable in some ORB implementations -
 * if that ever happens, then the debugger will need a redesign to support 
 * that ORB.
