	/**
	 * Contrary to the Java SDK implementation, we <b>will</b> have a metaobject
	 * representing the call stack. That is exactly what this object represents - 
	 * te virtual call stack for a distributed thread.
	 * 
	 * One might ask why. Well...
	 * 
	 * <ol>
	 * <li> Take a look at the polluted ThreadReference interface. </li>
	 * <li> Try to introspect the call stack in a java program. </li>
	 * </ol>
	 * 
	 * The <b>ThreadReference</b> class concetrates all methods for accessing
	 * the call stack, saturating its interface and decreasing cohesion. However,
	 * since the call stack is thread-related, that is not really a big problem.
	 * The worse part is if you try to introspect the call stack from a regular java
	 * program (not through the Java Debug Interface). After spending a few hours 
	 * on the problem, you might find out that you need the following code:
	 * 
	 * <code>
	 *	Throwable ex = new Throwable();
	 *	StackTraceElement [] stackTrace = ex.getStackTrace();
	 * </code>
	 * 
	 * That's quite honestly very ugly. Not to mention that the Throwable class is
	 * probably the last one you'll look for that information. Not to mention that 
	 * you probably wouldn't know that by simply creating a Throwable it acquires 
	 * knowledge about the call stack that you cannot find anywhere else in the Java 
	 * API.
	 * 
	 * 15/02/2005 - Decided to move this class into the DistributedThread class since they
	 * shared so much state anyway. The coupling was getting promiscuous.
