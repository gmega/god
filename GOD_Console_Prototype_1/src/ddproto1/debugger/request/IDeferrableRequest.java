/**
 * Deferrable Requests are, as their name implies, requests that could get
 * deferred until some set of preconditions is satisfied. Classes implementing
 * interface IDeferrableRequest normally need to register themselves with the
 * runtime environment, which will make them aware of which preconditions have
 * been met and which haven't. An IDeferrableRequest must advertise it's required
 * preconditions through method <b>getRequirements</b>. Supported precondition 
 * types are, as of now:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li><b> IDeferrableRequest.CLASSLOADING</b> satisfied when the class
 * loaded matches the one returned in IPrecondition#getClassId().</li>
 * 
 * <li><b> IDeferrableRequest.VM_CONNECTION</b> satisfied right at the time 
 * when the debugger attaches to the JVM and before any events are processed. </li>
 * 
 * <li><b> IDeferrableRequest.THREAD_PROMOTION</b> satisfied when the local thread with
 * dotted ID as returned by IPrecondition#getClassId() gets promoted to distributed
 * thread. </li>
 * 
 * <li><b> IDeferrableRequest.NIL</b> nil precondition. Always satisfied by default. </li>
 * 
 * </ol>

	 * precondition validators or subproducts in order to be able to resolve
	 * themselves. 
     * 
     * This interface defines an implicit protocol for resolution communication.
     * Resolution is conceptually broken into several phases by the preconditions.
     * At each fase (each resolveNow call), the underlying deferrable request should:
     * 
     * 1 - Return null if it couldn't solve this fase of its own resolution, even
     *     after the precondition has been met.
     *     
     * 2 - Throw an exception if an error occurs.
     * 
     * Note that those two are different. The first one indicates some sort of logic/
     * configuration error, or even a wrong precondition advertisement. The second 
     * indicates a runtime error which might or might not be due to the first error. 
     * Though the second error is more general, the first one is more serious and
     * therefore some effort must be done to detect it and follow the protocol.
	 * 
	 * <b>Note:</b> ClassCastExceptions may occur if the object passed as 
	 * context is of the wrong type.
